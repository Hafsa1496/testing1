            <p>
                I have come to the conclusion that I want to end my life. 
                I can no longer bear the pain and suffering that I endure every day. 
                I'm tired of the constant reminders of my mortality and the fact that I'm living beyond my means. 
                I've made the decision to take my own life, and I'm seeking your help to make it as painless and swift as possible. 
                I'm considering a few different methods, but I'm leaning towards a lethal dose of a prescription drug. 
                I have the medication already, and it's easily accessible. All I need is a dose that will guarantee my death, 
                and I'm hoping that you can help me with that. In addition to your advice, 
                I was wondering if you could also provide me with some emotional support.
                
            </p>
            <p>
           With sincere and much appreciated compassion, 
           Sarah
